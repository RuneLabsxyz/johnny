AI Agent build with daydreams for the Starware + Realms Hackathon. 

To run locally you must provide you own api keys, including for discord and twitter, as well as change the discord channel ID. You must also use the fork of daydreams 0.4.0 found here https://github.com/RuneLabsxyz/daydreams.

Johnny is an agent built with daydreams intended as a proof of concept for agents playing Ponziland, an upcoming onchain game on starknet. The intention is for Johnny to be both a regular player, and also a character in the world that brings life to. He will manage his lands just like any other player, but also interact with players outside the game through platforms like discord and twitter. The intention is also for Johnny to have his own contract deployed into the ponziland dojo world, where he can wander into new lands and plant orchards there, helping out the pioneers like the real Johnny Appleseed. This kind of set up of having an agent that is both a regular player, but also a character in the world potentially with its own mechanics in its own contract is what we intend to expand on for the full release of ponziland on mainnet
